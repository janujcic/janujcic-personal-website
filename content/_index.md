## On this page

You can find more information about my previous and current projects but also about my skills and professional experiences.

Additionally, I occasionally share short summaries of the books/articles I read and I would recommend to others. I also share some of the thoughts that cross my mind and seem interesting enough to write down and develop further. This site is also an attempt to write more and apply the [Feynmann method](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) to my own learning process.
