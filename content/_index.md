## On this page

You can find more information about my previous and current projects but also about my skills and professional experiences.

Additionally, I occasionally share short summaries of the books/articles I read and I would recommend to others. This site is also an attempt to write more and apply the [Feynmann method](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) to my own learning process.
