I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's Degree in Mechatronics but I since then moved closer to working with digital technology. I am currently working as a ServiceNow developer/architect but I was previously in roles such as Project Manager and Data Analyst/Engineer. I am currently living in Paris, therefore improving my fluency in French is currently one of my main priorities.
