    <h1>Hi and welcome!</h1>
    <p>I'm Jan and I'm very happy that you happened to stumble on this little piece of Internet property where
      I can share my thoughts and ideas without being tied to a specific platform. Indeed, personal websites are cool
      again
      and since I quite enjoy reading other people's websites I decided to make my own.</p>

    <h2>What I am currently working on</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I spend my time at work thinking about the architecture of our ServiceNow platform, including adding
      features to improve productivity
      as well as creating new value for our internal and external customers. In addition to that I am trying to bring to
      life CSDM
      (Common Service Data Model)
      in our business and apply it best to our very tricky specifics of a private provider of managed services.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a solution architect for <a href="https://dynamo-pcp.eu/pcp-phases/phase-3/pathfinder/">PATHFINDER</a>
      which is a business continuity solution for the health and care sector. Its main goal is to help organizations
      keep essential services operational during system shocks and unpredictable events (e.g. pandemic, heatwave, or
      staff shortage).
    </p>
    <p>
      In personal life I spend a lot of time learning new things, practicing and improving my French, and trying to do
      more DIY things (especially self-hosting and development).
    </p>
